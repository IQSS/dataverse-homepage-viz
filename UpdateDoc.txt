Data Update Documentation for Dataverse Homepage Visualization

There are two files that are used to produce the json needed to display the
Dataverse  Homepage Visualization (query2json.py, params.txt, and data.json). The
python script connects to the database, runs a query to obtain the needed data,
converts the output to json, and writes the json to an output file. The params.txt
file contains the credentials needed to connect the database and a parameter for
telling the script whether the database is a production database or a development
database. These params are in json format. An example follows:

{"db": "dvndb",
 "password": "secret",
 "port": 5432,
 "user": "dvnapp",
 "host": "127.0.0.1",
 "type": "production"
}

The plan is to run the update periodically. If we want to run it every night at
midnight the command would be:

0 0 * * * python <scriptdir>/query2json.py <paramsdir>/params.txt <datadir>/data.json
